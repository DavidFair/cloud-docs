Prevent Automatic Updates
============================

It is possible to prevent our curated images from automatically updating. This must only be done with the express written consent of the Cloud team. This can be obtained by emailing cloud-support@gridpp.rl.ac.uk

You still must comply with our terms of service.

Auto updating can be disabled by creating a file at /etc/noquattor. This file should contain the date the file is created and who created it.
